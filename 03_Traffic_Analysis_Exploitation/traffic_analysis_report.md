# Traffic Analysis Report

## Purpose
This report summarizes the network traffic analysis performed using Wireshark during the lab activities.

## Traffic Capture Setup

### How Traffic Was Captured:
- Interface: eth0

## Traffic Patterns Observed

### TCP Handshake Analysis

Based on `captures2.png`, several TCP three-way handshakes are observed, particularly for HTTP traffic on port 80. For instance, packets show the SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK sequence, indicating successful establishment of TCP connections between the source (192.168.50.10) and destination (192.168.50.11). This is a fundamental aspect of reliable communication over TCP/IP networks.

### Unencrypted Credentials

As observed in `captures5.png`, specifically in the HTTP traffic, there is evidence of unencrypted credentials being transmitted. The packet with `No. 1593` and `Length 190` clearly shows an HTTP GET request where the username and password appear to be part of the URL query string (`username=admin&password=admin`). This highlights a critical security vulnerability where sensitive information is exposed in plaintext.

### Nmap Scan Patterns

In the provided screenshots, `captures1.png` shows a significant amount of ICMP (ping) traffic from 192.168.50.10 to 192.168.50.11, which is characteristic of the host discovery phase of an Nmap scan. Additionally, the presence of various service-specific traffic (SSH, HTTP, FTP, DNS) in other captures suggests that port scanning and service enumeration, typically performed by Nmap, had occurred prior to or during the capture.

## Protocol Analysis

### HTTP Traffic

HTTP traffic, primarily on port 80, is extensively observed in `captures2.png` and `captures5.png`. This includes various GET requests for web pages, images, and other resources. The analysis of `captures5.png` specifically revealed the transmission of unencrypted login credentials within HTTP GET requests, indicating a severe security flaw. Other HTTP requests include access to DVWA, Mutillidae, TWiki, and PhpMyAdmin interfaces, which are known vulnerable web applications.

### DNS Traffic

`captures4.png` displays DNS traffic, specifically standard query and response packets for `TXT version.bind`. This indicates DNS queries being made to identify the version of the BIND DNS server running on the target. This type of query is often used during reconnaissance to gather information about the DNS server, which can then be used to identify known vulnerabilities.

### SSH Traffic

SSH traffic is visible in `captures1.png` and `captures3.png`. `captures3.png` shows the SSH handshake process, including Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange Request and Reply, followed by New Keys and Encrypted packet exchanges. This indicates that SSH connections are being established and encrypted, which is a positive security practice for remote access. However, the presence of SSH traffic also implies that the service is exposed and could be a target for brute-force attacks if not properly secured with strong authentication.

## Key Security Insights

*   Unencrypted Credential Transmission: The most critical security insight is the exposure of plaintext credentials over HTTP. This allows any attacker with network access to easily capture sensitive login information, leading to unauthorized access.
*   Outdated/Vulnerable Services: The presence of services like `vsFTPd 2.3.4` (from `captures.png` showing FTP responses), and the general nature of Metasploitable2, implies that many services are likely outdated and contain known vulnerabilities. While not directly shown in all captures, the Nmap scan patterns and specific service versions from the previous report corroborate this.
*   Reconnaissance Activities: The observed ICMP and DNS `version.bind` queries indicate active reconnaissance against the target, suggesting that the system is being probed for vulnerabilities.
*   Importance of Encryption: The contrast between unencrypted HTTP traffic and encrypted SSH traffic highlights the critical importance of using encrypted protocols for all sensitive communications.
