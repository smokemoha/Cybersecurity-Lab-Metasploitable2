# Focused Network Analysis & Security Hardening Lab: Metasploitable2 Edition

## Project Overview

As an aspiring cybersecurity engineer, I embarked on this hands-on lab to deepen my understanding of network analysis, vulnerability identification, and practical security hardening within an isolated virtual environment. This project was a wonderful experience, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge gained from networking courses to real-world scenarios. My primary objective was to demonstrate practical skills in identifying weaknesses and implementing basic defensive measures, which are crucial for building a robust security posture.

## Key Skills Demonstrated:

*   **Network Reconnaissance:** Employing tools and techniques to gather information about target systems and networks.
*   **Traffic Analysis:** Intercepting and interpreting network communications to understand system behavior and identify anomalies.
*   **Vulnerability Assessment:** Systematically identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing vulnerabilities in systems and applications.
*   **Basic Exploitation:** Safely demonstrating the impact of identified vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.
*   **Security Hardening:** Implementing measures to reduce the attack surface and improve the resilience of systems against cyber threats.
*   **Documentation:** Clearly articulating technical processes, findings, and recommendations.
*   **Virtualization:** Setting up and managing isolated lab environments for secure practice.

## Technologies & Tools Used:

*   **Kali Linux:** A Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing.
*   **Metasploitable2:** An intentionally vulnerable Linux virtual machine, designed for security training and testing.
*   **VirtualBox/VMware:** Virtualization software used to host the lab environment.
*   **Nmap:** A powerful network scanner used for discovery and security auditing.
*   **Wireshark:** A widely-used network protocol analyzer for deep inspection of network traffic.
*   **Metasploit Framework:** A penetration testing framework used for developing and executing exploit code against remote target machines.
*   **AI:** Utilized for documentation assistance and refining report clarity.
*   **Markdown:** For structured and readable project documentation.

## Key Learnings:

This project provided invaluable insights into the attacker's mindset and the critical importance of defense-in-depth. I learned:

*   The sheer volume of vulnerabilities present in unhardened systems and the ease with which they can be discovered.
*   The immediate and tangible impact of even basic hardening measures, such as firewall rules and service management.
*   The iterative nature of security: scan, identify, harden, and re-scan.
*   The importance of comprehensive documentation for tracking changes and communicating security posture.
*   How critical it is to understand network protocols and service functionalities to effectively secure a system.

## Project Phases/Structure:

This repository is organized into the following phases, each with detailed reports and supporting evidence:

*   **Phase 1: Lab Setup:** Documentation of the virtual lab environment configuration.
*   **Phase 2: Reconnaissance:** Detailed network reconnaissance and initial vulnerability identification.
*   **Phase 3: Traffic Analysis & Exploitation:** Showcasing network traffic analysis and controlled exploitation attempts.
*   **Phase 4: Hardening Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation of efforts to harden the Metasploitable2 VM, including before-and-after comparisons.

## How to Navigate This Repo:

Each phase folder contains detailed Markdown reports and supporting screenshots. Refer to the `lab_setup_guide.md`, `recon_report.md`, `traffic_analysis_report.md`, `exploitation_summary.md`, and `hardening_report.md` files for comprehensive documentation of each stage.
